<h2>
<a NAME="introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
One of the services provided by the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/xpfe">XP
Toolkit</a> is a collection of <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/xpfe/neededWidgets.html">widgets</a>
from which UIs will be composed. By widget, we mean graphical components
spanning the range from simple push buttons to complex aggregates like
combo-boxes or toolbars. The two ends of the spectrum of possible widget
implementation are:
<dl>
<dt>
a native widget</dt>

<dd>
A native widget has a look and feel unique to its platform. Its implementation
is, at least in part, and very probably in its entirety, specific to that
platform. Its core functionality may by supplied `pre-packaged' by the
OS.</dd>

<dt>
an XP widget</dt>

<dd>
An XP widget has a single implementation, intended to compile and run across
many target platforms. Its look and feel is similar, if not identical,
across those platforms.</dd>
</dl>
Both approaches have pros and cons, detailed below.
<h2>
<a NAME="objectives"></a>Objectives</h2>
To put this plan into context, consider the overall objectives of the team:
<ol>
<li>
Provide a set of cross-platform widgets, libraries and services that leverage
the NGLayout technology to allow single-source development of graphical
user interfaces.</li>

<ol>
<li>
Widgets</li>

<ol>
<li>
HTML 4.0 Forms widgets such as buttons, checkboxes and edit fields.</li>

<li>
General widgets not found in forms, like disclosure triangles and grippy
panes.</li>

<li>
Composite widgets such as tree views, toolbars and font pickers.</li>
</ol>

<li>
Services</li>

<ol>
<li>
Clipboard management</li>

<li>
Cursor management</li>

<li>
Menus and Context Menus</li>

<li>
Drag and Drop</li>

<li>
Tooltips</li>

<li>
File picker glue</li>

<li>
Keyboard Navigation</li>
</ol>
</ol>

<li>
Provide a common resource format for describing the static user interface
content, and a means for instantiating the UI from these resources.</li>

<li>
Provide a method for specifying stylistic variations separately from content.</li>

<li>
Support the the XP GUI needs of the Ender, XPApps and Messenger teams,
in particular by providing for downloadable chrome and running on Win32,
Linux, MacPPC and&nbsp; AIX.</li>
</ol>
This discussion, however, focuses on those objectives under 1.1, "Widgets".
<h2>
<a NAME="proposal"></a>Proposal</h2>

<ol>
<li>
The XPToolkit team will provide a a set of GFX widgets that sport a 'Netscape
platform' look and feel, details to be provided by the UE folks, who fully
support this direction. The XPToolkit team is on the hook for this, but
will hopefully be able to leverage work done by the NGLayout team providing
form widgets, and by net developers.</li>

<li>
The XPToolkit team will provide a 'cascading widget' architecture that
allows for implementation and substitution of native widgets. Everyone
agrees that native widgets are highly desirable, but until they are identified
as a crucial requirement, we don't intend to plan on doing them in this
release.</li>

<li>
As time/resources become available, native widgets may be implemented and
plugged in, according to the priorities of the developers doing the work
(e.g., Netscape would probably do Windows first). The XPToolkit team is
explicitly NOT committing to supply these in any particular timeframe.
We will evaluate doing some of this work when/if we have time in our schedule,
approval to add resources, or both.</li>
</ol>
<b>Pros:</b>
<ul>
<li>
This is probably the least amount of work for development, UE, I18N, L10N,
and QA, by a factor of 2 or 3 in some cases. It is the only strategy we
can see that meets our requirements within time and resource constraints.</li>

<li>
Doing a complete set of GFX widgets is the only route that allows a seamless
UI throughout the app, allowing maximum integration of the client, Netcenter,
and other web sites and web applications.</li>

<li>
It is an opportunity to develop a platform-agnostic Netscape UI, which
we can use on platforms that have UI religions, as well as the countless
information appliances to come, which could not possibly have their own
UI devotees.</li>

<li>
It allows us to change the rules on MS again. They can out-native us by
deploying armies of Mac and Windows programmers, but we can stake out the
high ground as the first Web Native applications, and say that they are
porting offline apps to the web.</li>
</ul>
<b>Cons:</b>
<ul>
<li>
Some users may not tolerate anything other than native platform look and
feel. We may not satisfy them until we go all the way.</li>

<li>
If we have to do native widgets on all platforms anyway, any work done
on non-forms GFX widgets may be unnecessary.</li>
</ul>
<b>Risks:</b>
<p>We have to do this in a big way, producing a Netscape UI that a large
number of users consider a better overall experience than the combination
of web and platform-specific UI they get elsewhere. This means appealing
to the large number of new Internet users expected in the target timeframe.
<h2>
<a NAME="alternatives"></a>Alternatives</h2>

<h3>
All Native Widgets</h3>
Any discussion of native widgets must be prefixed with the disclaimer that
generalizations are hard to make when, by definition, the issues are extremely
platform specific. The authors have made an attempt to be even-handed,
but some generalizations may be less than completely applicable.
<p><b>Pros:</b>
<ul>
<li>
A single native widget is typically easier to write than the equivalent
XP widget, since the OS provides the core functionality.</li>

<li>
Native widgets automatically handle desktop themes and appearance schemes.
In fact, native widgets are the only realistic way to accomplish this.
This is an important consideration in writing an application that will
be accepted by platform zealots.</li>

<li>
Native widgets will automatically handle changes to the desktop look and
feel as they are implemented by platform OS vendors.</li>
</ul>
<b>Cons:</b>
<ul>
<li>
Whether three native widgets are easier (read: quicker) to implement than
a single XP widget is a question best answered by taking both roads and
measuring the skid marks. The authors suspect three native implementations
to be an effort at least equal in magnitude to a single home-rolled version.
So while the comparative effort of implementation is difficult to measure
with any authority, the efforts of testing, maintenance, documentation
and internationalization are all almost certainly tripled.</li>

<li>
Native Widgets do not fit easily into the web content environment. Full
HTML/CSS compliance implies an ability to support such style as transparency
and z-ordering. Proper web page widgets will not be straightforward native
implementations; they will need to be owner-draw.</li>

<li>
Native widgets cannot be convinced not to follow desktop themes. The result
is web content, designed by web designers to be platform agnostic at best
or to favour Windows at worst, which can look unbalanced and goofy.</li>

<li>
Native widgets generally do not directly support internationalization.
The i18n group generally needs to hack every widget implementation to draw
in fonts requested by the web page. (Note this point is covered above,
but seemed to deserve specific mention since it is often overlooked.)</li>
</ul>
Native widgets are, in the authors' opinions, unsuitable for web content.
At best they do not respond to style specifications in the web content.
At worst they do respond to style specifications in the desktop theme.
XPFE believe they must provide XP implementations for all widgets which
can appear in web content; those being the forms widgets. Other widgets
could instead reasonably be native.
<h3>
All XP Widgets</h3>
<b>Pros:</b>
<ul>
<li>
A widget is finished after a single implementation has been written. Only
a single source base must be written, tested, localized and maintained.</li>

<li>
XP widgets can be given a consistent look and feel even across platforms.
Web content, which is seldom written with alternatives for different platforms,
looks better if it can be written to a single appearance. (We should probably
be as faithful to Communicator and IE appearances as possible in our "new"
design.)</li>

<li>
XP Widgets can be written to respond to the peculiar stylistic demands
of HTML/CSS. They stand the best chance of actually looking like web content.</li>

<li>
XP Widgets can be written to follow a consistent event model and API more
easily than a corral full of their disparate native cousins. That is, native
widgets may be difficult to fit into a library of consistent tools, while
a single home-rolled set stands a better chance of achieving this goal.</li>
</ul>
<b>Cons:</b>
<ul>
<li>
The effort of writing even a single XP widget is comparatively great.</li>

<li>
Taking the lesson of JFC to heart, XP widgets should not even try to look
like native versions, since they will necessarily not behave the same.
Look can be copied (until the native platform changes underneath), but
feel cannot be practically implemented cross-platform. Therefore, UIs implemented
with XP widgets will not feel and should not look native.</li>
</ul>
A set of XP forms widgets is a nearly inescapable requirement for providing
a consistent web content look and feel. XP non-forms widgets, which will
only be used in non-web content such as dialogs, will look alien on every
platform.
<h3>
Mixed Model</h3>
Given conclusions likely from the above considerations, that is, some widgets
favor an XP implementation and some favor native, one is led to consider
doing both. The mixed model is one in which some widgets are native and
some are cross-platform.
<p><b>Pros:</b>
<ul>
<li>
It's the best of both worlds. Widgets which should be cross-platform are.
Widgets which should be native are.</li>
</ul>
<b>Cons:</b>
<ul>
<li>
It's the worst of both worlds. While non-forms widgets will appear only
outside web content, forms widgets must appear in both environments. That
is, common widgets like radio buttons will clearly find themselves both
in web content and on dialogs. While web content will therefore behave
as described in the XP Widgets section, dialogs will contain a mixture
of native widgets and XP ones. This is a preposterous situation. Some controls
will respond to desktop themes, some will not. Some controls will behave
exactly as native controls, being native, and some will have subtle differences
confounding to users. (For example: a Windows Tab control is generally
activated on mousedown; no Macintosh control is ever activated on anything
but mouseup. Pick one.)</li>

<li>
XP ("lightweight," "windowless") controls do not mix well with native ("heavyweight")
controls. This may not present any real problem unless native controls
overlap XP controls, in which case z-ordering becomes difficult to control.
Honestly, dialogs could generally be designed to avoid this issue, but
discussions of problems with Java's AWT often mention this issue as if
it were a problem. Some controls such as tabs and bordered groups naturally
overlap other controls.</li>
</ul>
The mixed model is, at first glance, a ridiculous chimera undeserving of
more than glancing notice. At the same time, both the full native and full
cross-platform proposals are also unsatisfying. XPFE believe the right
solution is a variety of the mixed model.
<h2>
<a NAME="faq"></a>Appendix: Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
Answers to the bulk of the questions can be found above, but are summarized
here because people keep asking them.
<h3>
Won't using XP widgets mean forcing the user to learn a whole new interface?</h3>
No. An XP interface doesn't mean an <i>alien</i> interface. Consider it,
rather, platform neutral. Can a Mac user decipher a typical dialog on a
Windows machine? Certainly. Can a Windows user decipher a typical dialog
on a Mac? Of course. A checkbox is a checkbox. A radio button is a radio
button. Users familiar with these concepts will recognize them in a conservative
XP implementation. Examine some of the UI presented by Netcenter: cross
platform dialogues with users, e.g., to login, or to sign up. The success
of Netcenter, CD-ROMs, games, AOL, and others, offers positive proof that
an XP UI need not be a barrier to user understanding.
<h3>
Aren't interfaces built from XP widgets ugly? Look at HTML dialogs!</h3>
Not necessarily. Again, examine some of the interfaces presented by Netcenter.
<h3>
Should we use GTK?</h3>
Whether to use <a href="http://www.gtk.org/">GTK</a> to implement our XP
widgets is orthogonal to this discussion. GTK could give us a flexible
XP implementation for widgets, that harmonizes well with the Open Source
community. It needs to be ported to the Macintosh, and it needs to be enhanced
for Unicode support, but it already has a devoted following. We are currently
trying to evaluate the effort required to use GTK compared to that of writing
our XP widgets from scratch. However, the possibility of using GTK does
not effect the priorities of our implementation.
<h3>
Native controls are easy. Why do you keep saying they're hard?</h3>
Native widgets are easy. Sometimes. As long as you don't try to do anything
unusual with them, and have a lot of engineering resources to throw at
them.
<p>Everyone agrees that we already require XP widgets for web page <i>content</i>.
Content developers really want this in order to provide a consistent look
and feel for their web page across all browsers. Most importantly, however,
the native widgets on all 3 tier-one platforms are not up to snuff when
it comes to HTML 4.0 compliance. They cannot be arbitrarily colored, composited,
or easily placed on backgrounds. As a result, we already have a requirement
to produce XP form widgets even though there are perfectly good native
widgets at our disposal.
<p>In dialogs, however, people want native look and feel. That means they
want to use native widgetry. So in addition to writing all the XP form
widgets, we also have to write native form widgets so everything appears
consistent. Along with the form widgets, we also need to write the set
of widgets that reside in dialogs but not forms (tabs, sliders, color pickers,
etc).
<p>Summarizing, we have one set of XP form widgets, one set of native form
widgets, and one set of dialog widgets. But wait, native form widgets require
platform engineers on three platforms. So in reality, we have one set of
XP form widgets, 3 sets of native form widgets, and 3 sets of dialog widgets.
In a perfect world, this might not be a problem. Even without native widgets,
our schedule goes way past the target delivery date, adding them would
require adding significant resources.
<br><!--
<H3>Won't web-based forms built out of native controls look goofy?</H3>

<P>
	Yes.
	Web designers expect forms to look the same on all platforms.
	That's one reason why we must supply at least the set of XP widgets that satisfy
		<A href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/">HTML 4.0</A>
		<A href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/interact/forms.html">forms</A>.
</P>

<h3>
Won't dialogs that mix XP and native widgets look goofy?</h3>
Potentially, especially if native themes are not fully supported. There
are also issues with how XP widgets would programmatically fit into an
otherwise native dialog. That's why doing native widgets at all  may require
doing a complete set, including native versions of the Forms widgets we
already need to provide as XP widgets. If we do commit to implementing
full native and cross-platform versions of all widgets, we could then specify
dialogs which are composed exclusively of one or the other, so the two
need not coexist.
<h3>
Won't applications that mix XP and native dialogs look goofy?</h3>
Not any goofier  than Communicator, where we used several quite slow, clunky
and ugly HTML dialogs due to resource constraints. We didn't like it, but
it didn't seem to drive away many users. Actually, given the superior capabilities
and performance of NGLayout, it should be possible to implement simple
or obscure dialogs in an XP manner without detracting from native implementations
of prominent or sophisticated windows and dialogs.
<h3>
Won't XP widgets based services embedded in native apps look goofy?</h3>
Even if we use native widgets, we may still encounter this problem. The
reason being that application developers don't always use standard widgets
in their own dialogs. Some draw the standard widgets themselves to fix
bugs, some create their own widgets from scratch that don't match the native
appearance. If our widgets were fully native, they would look out of place
alongside these application-rendered widgets, and we would be no better
off than if we used XP widgets.
<h3>
How can XP widgets keep up with native look and feel as OSs move forward?</h3>
They can't. We don't want them to. Down that road lies madness.
<p>The plan, as we move forward, is to augment our XP widgets with native
ones. Only native implementations can keep up with the native look and
feel for an OS. While we do not have resources internally to attain that
goal, we must design the architecture so that others can. If Net developers
(or even OS vendors like Apple) get so motivated, they can write their
own widgets (since they're so easy, see the previous question) and submit
them through mozilla.org.
<p>The architecture will be designed so that in, say, August we can ship
a SmartUpdate module with replacement widgets which have native implementations
and suddenly Communicator looks much more native.
<h3>
GTK has `skins'. Doesn't that solve your native look and feel problem?</h3>
GTK provides <a href="http://gtk.themes.org">Themes</a> (also called skins)
where a designer can customize the look of a widget by providing "a scheme
of pixmaps, gradients or solid colors that are applied to all elements
of GTK such as buttons with backgrounds, backgrounds in windows etc." There
are web pages full of pretty cool looking schemes, which serve simply to
indicate that our XP widgets can be made to look cool while retaining user
recognizability.
<p>As this question poses, can't we just ship themes that look like each
native platform? This is probably the worst thing we could do. We would,
in fact, be tricking the poor unsuspecting user because the widget they
see may <i>look</i> like a widget they are used to from other applications,
but because it is an XP widget, chances are very good that it would not
<i>behave</i> like the native widget.
<p>Skins give us look, but not feel, and are in fact damaging to the user
experience if used in this manner. As a result, it is imperative that XP
widgets have their own look and feel, so as not to elicit comparison to
existing widgets.
