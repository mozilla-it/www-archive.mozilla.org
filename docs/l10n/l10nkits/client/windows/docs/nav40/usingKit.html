<A NAME="usekit"></A>3. Using the Kit</H2>
Once your copy of the Windows Front End Localization Kit is correctly installed,
you may begin your localization work by following the instructions in the
remainder of this document. The next section discusses the contents of
the localization notes provided with this kit. It is important that
you work properly with the instructions contained in these files or the
localized product you create may not function.
<H3>
<A NAME="locdbf"></A>Understanding the Localization Notes</H3>
Each binary file to be localized has an associated localization notes file,
called a "DOG" file. These files are created by the Netscape translation
tool, ToolCool. For a complete description of the process used to create
these files, please consult the <B>Netscape Translation Tool User's Guide
</B>that comes with those tools. It is very important that you work properly
with these localization notes, as they contain the bulk of the instructions
for this project. Most importantly, the .DOG files identify the "forbidden"
resources - those resources that you must not change.

<P>Each DOG file associated with a. dll or .exe has the same name as the
binary file, but will have the extension .DOG.
<UL>E.g. <B><TT>RESDLL.DLL</TT></B> has an associated <B><TT>RESDLL.DOG</TT></B></UL>
The .DOG file lists certain information about each resource contained in
the associated binary file:

<P>
Resource IDs are made up of a combination of the resource type and a unique
identifier, depending on the type of resource. See the individual
sections dealing with each resource type for a description of how resources
are identified. You must not change the contents of this field.

<P>The original English string is what you need to translate; however,
your translation must go in the XL_STR field. It is not useful to change
the contents of the US_STR field.

<P>Your translation will be done in the XL_STR field. If there is no leveraged
translation from a prior version, this string will originally match the
US_STR value.

<P>If a resource requires some extra explanation, this can be found in
the COMMENT field.

<P>The REASON field indicates the results of the leveraging process which
created the database, which in turn was used to generate the .DOG file.
Unless you are using the Netscape translation tools, this field is not
useful to you.

<P>The TRANSLATE field dictates whether or not you can change the value
of the XL_STR field. If this field is blank, the resource is OK to translate;
if the value is "FALSE", you must not translate it. (When viewed through
ToolCool, this field appears as a check box. When checked, you may translate
this resource; when unchecked, you may not.)

<P>The next section presents the basic localization process as a checklist.

<H3>
<A NAME="l10nchecklist"></A>Localization Checklist</H3>
The basic localization process is this:

<P><B>1. Create your working directories</B>
<BR>Copy the English directory (<B><TT>kitRoot\products\client\windows\<I>platform</I>\en</TT></B>)
to a new directory at the same level. Be sure to use the appropriate
naming convention for your new directory. This is the ISO 639:1988
standard (<I>Code for the representation of names of languages</I>).
A sub-set of these codes can be found in the accompanying <A HREF="isocodes.htm">table</A>.
You can go <A HREF="http://www.indigo.ie/egt/standards/iso639/iso639-1-en.html">here</A>
for a complete listing of the standard.

<P><B>2. Identify files to localize</B>
<BR>Consult the <A HREF="localize_these_files.html#table1">Localize These
Files</A> page to learn which binary files contain localizable resources.

<P>For each file to be localized, follow these steps using the tool of
your choice, being careful to follow all instructions contained in the
Localization Notes for that resource.:
<UL>
<LI>
Localize the STRINGTABLE resources</LI>

<LI>
Localize the MENU resources</LI>

<LI>
Localize the DIALOG resources</LI>

<LI>
Localize the Javascript preferences stored in DATA resources (<TT>RESDLL.DLL</TT>
only)</LI>

<LI>
Localize the remaining DATA resources (<TT>RESDLL.DLL</TT> only)</LI>
</UL>
<B>3. Localize external files</B>
<BR>In addition to the binary resource modules requiring localization,
there are a number of external files which <I>may </I>need to be localized<SUP><FONT SIZE=-1><A HREF="#fn1">1<A NAME="fn1_source"></A></A></FONT></SUP>:
these are listed in the <A HREF="localize_these_files.html#table2">Localize
These Files</A> page. Further instructions can be found there.

<P><B>4. Complete post-translation processing</B>
<BR>After translation is complete, you need to test your work and deal
with any problems:
<UL>
<LI>
Test the localized product.</LI>

<LI>
Fix translation bugs using your localization tools or a resource editor.</LI>

<LI>
Fix dialog size bugs using your localization tools or a resource editor.</LI>

<LI>
Report core bugs to Netscape.</LI>
</UL>
<B>5. Return kits (optional)</B>
<BR>Finally, you may be required to deliver files back to Netscape:
<UL>
<LI>
Return the necessary files to Netscape (if required).</LI>

<LI>
Inform us that the localized files have been returned (if required).</LI>
</UL>

<A NAME="howtol10n"></A>How to Localize Different Resource Types</H2>
This section provides you with general information about localizing the
various resource types and files found with this kit. (Remember,
specific localization notes for binary resources is found in the associated
.DOG file.)
<H3>
<A NAME="localizeURLs"></A>Localizing URLs</H3>

<UL>Many resources of all types in the Communicator contain Internet addresses
in the form of URLs (Universal Resource Locators). Because many of these
URLs originally point to locations within the Netscape domain, how they
are localized depends on whether you are creating a branded Netscape version
or not. The rules for how to handle URLs are found <A HREF="localizeURL.html">here</A>.</UL>

<H3>
<A NAME="localize_stringtable"></A>Localizing String Tables</H3>

<UL>STRINGTABLE resources are the most sensitive, potentially problematic
resource type you will be working with. Therefore, you must pay close attention
to the instructions provided in the localization notes.
<H4>
<A NAME="locnote_stringtable"></A>Localization Notes</H4>
String table resources are identified by the word STRINGTABLE, followed
by the numeric resource ID generated from the project's header files.
For example, in the file BRPREF32.DLL, STRINGTABLE109 contains the label
and explanatory text for the Languages pane of the preference dialog.
Localization notes for string table resources are provided in the comments
field for each resource contained in the associated .DOG file. Please pay
special attention to these notes and to the TRANSLATE field. In general,
be aware of the following:
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>
Many strings contain C++ print format strings, such as %s, %ld, %lu, etc.
Do not modify these while translating the rest of the string.</LI>

<LI>
Many strings contain new line characters: \n. In general, you should
try leave these as you find them. In some cases, the new line is
used to delimit a matched set of strings used to build a button label,
a ToolTip and a status bar message all relating to single control. In these
cases, you must preserve the new line characters.</LI>

<LI>
Many strings actually show up as part of an HTML or Javascript document
or dialog. Be careful not to break format tags, like &lt;TITLE>,
&lt;FONT>, etc. by translating these.</LI>
</UL>
</UL>

<H3>
<A NAME="localize_menus"></A>Localizing Menus</H3>

<UL>Menu translation is usually not as tricky as localizing string tables;
however, you should take care to assign unique pickletters to menu choices.
This process can be made difficult by the fact that some strings that appear
in menus at runtime actually come from string tables. The special
ID Build provided in this kit can help you find these.
<H4>
<A NAME="locnote_menus"></A>Localization Notes</H4>
Menu resources are identified first by the word MENU, then by a resource
number, then by a sequential Item number. For example, in RESDLL.DLL, MENU2ITEM0
contains the word "&amp;File". This resource is the first item in menu
structure structure #2 (the File menu). The ampersand character (&amp;)
denotes the pickletter is the letter "F". Localization notes for
individual MENU resource items are provided in the comments field for that
item in the localization databases. Not all MENU resource items need to
be translated so again, please pay special attention to these notes and
to the TRANSLATE field!</UL>

<H3>
<A NAME="localize_dialogs"></A>Localizing Dialogs</H3>

<UL>Dialog translation is usually not as tricky as localizing string tables;
however, you should take care to assign unique pickletters to dialog controls.
This process can be made difficult by the fact that some strings that appear
in menus and dialogs at runtime actually come from string tables.
The special ID Build provided in this kit can help you find these. Once
a DIALOG resource has been translated, the dialog may need to be resized
using a visual resource editor, such as MSDEV (Microsoft<SUP><FONT SIZE=-1>&reg;</FONT></SUP>
Visual C++ 4.0 or greater) or Borland<SUP><FONT SIZE=-1>&reg;</FONT></SUP>
Resource Workshop.
<H4>
<A NAME="locnote_menus"></A>Localization Notes</H4>
Dialog resources are identified first by the word DIALOG , then by a resource
number, then by a sequential Item number. For example, in NSMAILUI.DLL,
DIALOG129Item0 contains the word "Password". This resource is the first
item (the dialog title) in DIALOG129. Localization notes for individual
DIALOG resource items are provided in the comments field for that item
in the localization databases. Not all DIALOG resource items need to be
translated so again, please pay special attention to these notes and to
the TRANSLATE field!</UL>

<UL><B>A special note on Dialog fonts</B>:
<BR>The second item in each dialog definition (e.g. DIALOGnnnITEM1) is
the font information for that dialog. If you find it necessary to
change the font name or size, be aware of the following fact: the font
size is represented in the translation database by the ASCII character
corresponding to that size. In the US product the default font size
is 9, which appears as a Horizontal Tab (Font size = 9 = ASCII character
9 = tab). In the database, this will appear as an unprintable character,
such as a black box. There are two concerns here: first, if you change
the font name, be careful not to accidentally delete the tab character.
Second, if you decide to change the font size, you can do so by substituting
the appropriate ASCII character which matches the new size you want.
For example, to change the font size to 10, replace the tab with a Line
Feed character (ASCII 10). This is rather confusing, so it is probably
best to avoid changing the fonts if possible.</UL>

<H3>
<A NAME="localize_prefs"></A>Localizing Javascript Preferences</H3>

<UL>Javascript is used to define default preference information for the
Communicator and it's components. These preferences end up stored
in the DATA section of RESDLL.DLL. You can use the ToolCool to edit these
just as you would STRINGTABLE resources, or use your preferred localization
tools.

<P>There are two groups of localizable Javascript preferences: ALL_PREFS
and CONFIG_PREFS. Most of these preference settings are not localizable;
these are marked as forbidden in the localization notes. Those that
are localizable should be treated very carefully, as Javascript is rather
particular about the format of the data it receives. Pay special
attention not to unbalance quotes, delete the preceding tab characters,
etc.</UL>

<UL>
<H4>
<A NAME="locnote_allprefs"></A>Localization Notes for ALL_PREFS</H4>
The entries in the ALL_PREFS section contain the default values for certain
cross-platform preferences, including some crucial for the correct operation
of localized versions. The rules for how to handle this section are
found <A HREF="localizeAllPref.html">here</A>.
<H4>
<A NAME="locnote_configprefs"></A>Localization Notes for CONFIG_PREFS</H4>
The entries in the CONFIG_PREFS section make up the configurable Toolbar
and Help menu items and their functions. How they are localized depends
on whether you are creating a branded Netscape version or not. The
rules for how to handle this section are found <A HREF="localizeConfigPref.html">here</A>.</UL>

<H3>
<A NAME="localize_rcdata"></A>Localizing DATA</H3>

<UL>There are several additional resources stored as DATA that cannot be
edited using ToolCool. Therefore, you must use a resource editor
and a text editor to localize these by following this procedure.
(This example uses Microsoft<SUP><FONT SIZE=-1>&reg;</FONT></SUP> MSDEV;
if you prefer a different resource editor you may need to execute slightly
different steps).</UL>

<UL>
<UL>
<LI>
Open the file containing the DATA resources (usually RESDLL.DLL)</LI>

<LI>
Expand the DATA resource type.</LI>

<LI>
Select the resource you want to localize</LI>

<LI>
Choose <B><TT>Edit | Select All.</TT></B></LI>

<LI>
Choose <B><TT>Edit | Copy</TT></B>.</LI>

<LI>
Open a text editor window by clicking on the new document icon (or if you
prefer, you may use any other text editor).</LI>

<LI>
Choose <B><TT>Edit | Paste</TT></B>.</LI>

<LI>
You should now have the text representation of the DATA resource in your
text editor window. You may localize it according to the instructions in
the Localization Notes section for each DATA resource.</LI>

<LI>
When done, save your work, then select ALL the text (use Edit | Select
All if your editor supports this).</LI>

<LI>
Choose <B><TT>Edit | Copy</TT></B>.</LI>

<LI>
Go back to the RESDLL.DLL in MSDEV and select the DATA resource you have
translated.</LI>

<LI>
Choose <B><TT>Edit | Select All</TT></B>.</LI>

<LI>
Choose <B><TT>Edit | Paste</TT></B>.</LI>

<LI>
You should now see the original English DATA resource replaced by your
translated version.</LI>

<LI>
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><BLINK>IMPORTANT</BLINK>:</FONT> Go to the end of
the resource and insert a NULL value by typing the number zero (0) in the
first empty byte position.</LI>

<LI>
Close the resource and save your work.</LI>
</UL>
</UL>

<UL>Consult the <A HREF="localize_these_files.html#table3">Localize These
Files</A> to see the list of DATA resources that require localization:</UL>

<H3>
<A NAME="localize_text"></A>Localizing External Files</H3>

<UL>As mentioned above, you may choose (or be required) to translate several
external files. If this is the case, the links contained in the text
file section of <A HREF="localize_these_files.html#table2">Localize These
Files</A> will tell you what to do. (Note: this may be nothing at all).</UL>

<H3>
<A NAME="localize_npnul"></A>Localizing the NULL Plugin</H3>

<UL>The so-called "NULL" plugin is the default plugin that ships with all
versions of the Communicator. It's job is to list the plugins that
you have installed, and if you don't have a requested plugin, to help you
get it.

<P>The name and location of the NULL plugin is given in the <A HREF="localize_these_files.html#table2">Localize
These Files</A> binary file section. Localization notes have been provided
for you to use when localizing the resources for this file. Instructions
for individual resources can be found in the COMMENT field of the matching
.DOG file.
